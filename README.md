Task Details
Question 1: Remove Vowels from a String
Objective:
Write a Java program that removes all vowels from a given string.
Files Involved:
- RemoveVowels.java
Functionality:
- The program prompts the user to enter a string.
- The vowels are removed from the string using a custom method.
- The modified string is displayed with all vowels removed.
Sample Input and Output:
Input: Enter a string: hello, world!
Output: The string with vowels removed is: hll, wrld!
Question 2: Implement a Stack using an Array
Objective:
Implement a stack using an array in Java with the following functionalities:
- push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- pop: Removes and returns the top element.
- peek: Returns the top element without removing it.
- isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
Files Involved:
- ArrayStack.java
- Operations_on_Stack.java
Functionality:
- ArrayStack is the core class that defines the stack using an array.
- Operations_on_Stack.java demonstrates the stack operations such as push, pop, peek, and
checking if the stack is empty.
Sample Input and Output:
Stack Operations:
1. Push
2. Pop
3. Peek
4. Check if Empty
5. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter an element to push: 10
